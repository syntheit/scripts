# Scripts
A collection of useful scripts I've written to automate tasks.

Feel to use/modify any of them.  If you make edits that you think make the scripts better, feel free to open a PR.

I run these scripts on a pair of Fedora 36 machines.  Everything included in this repo has been tested on Fedora (with SELinux in enforcing mode).
